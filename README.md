  logo mark (the overlapping squares icon used in the app header) next to
  the "ClearCut" wordmark, on a dark background (#060a10) with the cyan/teal
  gradient glow used throughout the UI. This sets the tone before anyone
  reads a single line of text.

**Privacy-first, in-browser AI background removal.**
No uploads. No servers. No tracking. Just your browser and your GPU/CPU.

  Suggested: a screen recording (GIF or MP4 converted to GIF) showing the
  full flow: drag an image into the dropzone → AI processing indicator →
  before/after compare slider revealing the cut-out result. Capture both
  light and dark mode if possible, or pick the mode you prefer as the
  primary showcase. Ideal size: 1280×800px or similar 16:10 ratio.

## Overview

ClearCut is a web application that removes the background from any photo entirely **on-device**, using a machine learning model that runs locally in the browser via [Transformers.js](https://huggingface.co/docs/transformers.js). Images are never uploaded to a server — all inference happens client-side, inside a dedicated Web Worker, so the tab stays responsive while the model runs.

Beyond automatic background removal, ClearCut includes an interactive **mask refinement editor** with a Photoshop-style smart brush, letting users restore or erase parts of the AI-generated mask with pixel-level precision before exporting a transparent PNG.

This project was built as a personal exploration of running production-grade computer vision models fully client-side, combined with a polished, modern UI/UX.

<br />

## Key Features

- **100% local processing** — the AI model is downloaded once and runs entirely in your browser. No image data ever leaves the tab.
- **Drag-and-drop upload** — simple, fast image input via a dedicated dropzone component.
- **Background removal powered by Transformers.js** — runs a segmentation model on-device using WebAssembly/WebGPU, offloaded to a Web Worker to keep the UI thread free.
- **Before/after compare slider** — interactively reveal the processed result against the original image.
- **Smart brush mask editor** — a Quick Selection–style tool that lets you restore or erase mask areas with adjustable brush size and color-similarity tolerance.
- **Light / dark mode** — fully themed interface with persisted user preference.
- **One-click PNG export** — download the final cut-out image with a transparent background.
- **Zero backend** — a fully static site, deployable to GitHub Pages or any static host.

  IMAGE 3 — Mask refinement editor
  Suggested: a screenshot of the editor mode (the split-panel layout) showing
  the smart brush in action — ideally mid-stroke, with the brush cursor
  visible and a visible "before/after" difference in the mask. This is the
  most technically interesting feature, so a clear, well-lit screenshot
  (or short GIF) helps a lot here. Approx. 1280×720px.

## Tech Stack

| Layer | Technology |
|---|---|
| UI Framework | [React 18](https://react.dev/) + [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/) |
| Build Tool | [Vite 5](https://vitejs.dev/) (`@vitejs/plugin-react-swc`) |
| Styling | [Tailwind CSS 3](https://tailwindcss.com/) |
| AI / ML Inference | [`@huggingface/transformers`](https://huggingface.co/docs/transformers.js) (Transformers.js) |
| Concurrency | Web Worker (off-main-thread inference) |
| Image Processing | Canvas API (`ImageData`, pixel-level mask compositing) |
| Notifications / Toasts | [`sileo`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/sileo) |
| Deployment | GitHub Pages (`gh-pages`) |

<br />

## How It Works

1. **Upload** — the user drops an image into the `Dropzone` component. The file is decoded into raw `ImageData` on the main thread.
2. **Inference** — the image is dispatched to a background `Worker` (via the `useBackgroundWorker` hook), which runs the segmentation model loaded through `@huggingface/transformers`. The main thread stays fully responsive while this happens.
3. **Result** — the worker returns a processed `ImageData` mask, which is rendered as a transparent-background PNG and shown in an interactive **before/after compare slider**.
4. **Refinement (optional)** — the user can enter the editor view (`MaskEditorOverlay`), where a smart brush tool allows manually restoring or erasing parts of the mask based on adjustable brush size and color-similarity tolerance — without ever leaving the browser or re-uploading anything.
5. **Export** — the final image is composited on a `<canvas>`, converted to a PNG `Blob`, and downloaded directly — no server round-trip at any point in the pipeline.

<br />

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) 18 or later
- npm (bundled with Node.js)

### Installation

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/marcantero/ClearCut.git
cd ClearCut

# Install dependencies
npm install

# Start the development server
npm run dev
```

> **Note:** on first load, the AI model will be downloaded and cached by the browser. This may take a few seconds depending on your connection — subsequent loads will be much faster.

### Available Scripts

| Command | Description |
|---|---|
| `npm run dev` | Starts the Vite development server with hot reload |
| `npm run build` | Builds the app for production into `dist/` |
| `npm run preview` | Serves the production build locally for testing |
| `npm run deploy` | Builds and publishes the app to GitHub Pages |
